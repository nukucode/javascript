/* Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts. I diescovered that i could be a better programming by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts. After all, how can you build something good out of bad parts?



* The best parts if javascript include:
=> functions
=> loose typing (variables are declared as variables, without a type)
=> dynamic objects
=> object literal notation (where you can create object already with a list of key/value pairs inside curly braces).


! The worst part include global variables - there is a comman golobal object namespace where they're all lumped together and they're essential to the language.

Javascript has a class free object makeup, relying instead on objects inheriting properties directly from other objects - this is prototypal inheritance.
