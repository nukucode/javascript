//: Facade Structural Design Pattern

/* This is a structural design pattern that is widely used in the javascript libraries. It is used to provide a unified and simpler, public-facing interface for ease of use that shields away from the complexities of its consisting subsystems or subclasses.

=> The use of this pattern is very common in libraries like jQuery.*/
