/* A parser or syntax parser is a program that reads your code line-by-line. It understand how the code fits the syntax defined by the programing Language and what if (the code) is expected to do. */

//* JavaScript Engine

/* A javascript engine is simply a computer program that recives javascript source code and compiles it to the binary instruction (machine code) that a cpu can understand. Javascript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and each major browser has one. */

//* Function Declarations

/* These are function that are assigned a name */

//* Function Expressions

/* These are anonymouse functions, that is function without a function name like "js function () {}". They are usually used in statement, like assigning a function to a variable */

let someValue = function () {
  // statements
};
